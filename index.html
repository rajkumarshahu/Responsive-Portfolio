          Currently, I am enrolled in UofT Coding Bootcamp which provides
          extensive training in fullstack webdevelopment technology.

        <p>
          I recently graduated from George Brown College where I obtained
          various forms of computer programming languages, as well as in the
          applied and theoretical aspects of computer hardware and networking. I
          have thoroughly benefitted from the instructive challenges that George
          Brown’s School of Computer Technology has afforded.
        </p>

        <p>
          More importantly, through the combination of training at George
          Brown’s state-of-the-art computer laboratories, I have acquired
          hands-on experience in all aspects of computer programming including,
          professional communications, administrative duties and computer
          hardware and networking. Throughout my practical and academic courses
          at George Brown, I consistently displayed both an aptitude and an
          enthusiasm for the task at hand.
